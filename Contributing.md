## Collaboration is awesome

and contributions from others are encouraged, especially towards expanding and/or maintaining this codebase.

### Please do not file an "issue" or send email to ask programming questions 

Instead see "How to get Answers to Programming Questions" below.

## Issues that include a pull request

are awesome! but should not break existing usage.  This may be a stricter standard than simply passing the current test suite.

## Issues that are bug reports 

Consider that there may be errors in documentation.  When tested source code here conflicts with the documentation,
it is usually the documentation that will be adjusted to match the tested behavior.  If you think the documentation
needs adjustment, please let me know but also be specific as far as suggesting what documentation language needs to change.

For bugs in code, please include a MCVE, that is, a [minimum, complete, verifiable example](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve).
A good MCVE could serve as the basis for test code so the problem does not recur in the future.

## Issues that are feature requests

are ok, but I probably don't have time to code it for free unless I need it too...

## Code of Conduct

Civility is governed by [the Contributor Covenant v1.4](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/).

Copyright of all code contributions shall be licensed under the MIT License.  

### How to get Answers to Programming Questions:

If the question directly concerns webdismay, please read the programmers docmentation on ESDoc and check the source code. 
Most of the source code here is a simple wrapper around other functionality, either the fetch web API or redis/webdis 
functionality.  All functionality here ultimately maps to [documented redis commands](http://redis.io/commands)

For broader questions about promises or Javascript, research your programming question on Google/Bing/NPM/Github first... then ask on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com)

Why ask on Stack Overflow?

* 24 hours a day, 7 days a week they have a community of experts. 
* Someone on Stack Overflow may take an interest in your question quickly, way before that will happen on this github site.
* Stack Overflow has standards on what constitutes a decent question.  If your question is rejected, fix it and maybe
it will get answered or, even better, you will learn something that allows you to answer your own question.  
* If a question is too broad for Stack Overflow, it is probably too broad to answer for free here, as well.
